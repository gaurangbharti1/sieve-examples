# Text to Manim

This function can generate a animation using the [Manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/tree/main) library from a text. It does so by generating Manim code from a text prompt using Claude 3 Opus and then running the generated code to create the animation. To use this function in your Sieve account, please make sure to have an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret set up in your account [here](https://www.sievedata.com/dashboard/settings/secrets).
