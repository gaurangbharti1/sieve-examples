# ElevenLabs Voice Cloning

This function lets you use ElevenLabs' voice cloning API on Sieve. Read more about it [here](https://docs.elevenlabs.io/voicelab/instant-voice-cloning). After passing in a reference audio to clone here, you may use the [Speech Synthesis](https://sievedata.com/functions/sieve/elevenlabs_text_to_speech) function here.

To use this function, you will need to enter an ElevenLabs API key which you can get by signing up on their [site](https://elevenlabs.io/).
