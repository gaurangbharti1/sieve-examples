# ElevenLabs Text to Speech

This function lets you use ElevenLabs' Text to Speech API on Sieve. Read more about it [here](https://docs.elevenlabs.io/introduction). To clone a voice, you may use the [Voice Cloning](https://sievedata.com/functions/sieve/elevenlabs_voice_cloning) function here and pass the ID returned into this function.

To use this function, you will need to enter an ElevenLabs API key which you can get by signing up on their [site](https://elevenlabs.io/).
