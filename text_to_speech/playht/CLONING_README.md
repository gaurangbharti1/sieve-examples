# Play.ht Voice Cloning

This function lets you use Play.ht's voice cloning API on Sieve. Read more about it [here](https://docs.play.ht). After passing in a reference audio to clone here, you may use the [Speech Synthesis](https://sievedata.com/functions/sieve/playht_speech_synthesis) function here.

To use this function, you will need to enter an Play.ht API key which you can get by signing up on their [site](https://play.ht/).
