# Audio Enhancement

Try passing in a noisy audio file and see the difference. There are 3 different filter types you can try out:
* `upsample` - Upsamples audio and makes speech sound clearer
* `noise` - Dampens background noise from audio
* `all` - Removes background noise and upsamples the audio

Please refer to the licenses for each of the models used.
