# Illusion Diffusion HQ

Thanks to andreasjansson and lucataco

Based off of the [cog-illusion-diffusion-hq repo](https://github.com/lucataco/cog-illusion-diffusion-hq), this is an implementation of [Monster Labs' QR code control net](https://huggingface.co/monster-labs/control_v1p_sd15_qrcode_monster)
Set `seed` to `-1` to generate a random seed. For more temporally consistent results (such as when using this to generate video), use a non-`-1` seed.
